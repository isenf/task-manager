## üìñ Features
- **User authentication**: register and login functionality.  
- **Task management**: create, edit, and delete tasks.  
- **Password encryption**: securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.  
- **JWT implementation**: generate and verify JSON Web Tokens for authentication.  
- **Route and permission control**: middleware to verify access permissions.  
- **Session management with cookies**: store authentication tokens in cookies for better security.  
- **Database integration**: uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage and retrieval.

## üöÄ Main Technologies
- Node.js - JavaScript runtime for server-side development.  
- Express - minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js.  
- MongoDB - NoSQL database for storing app data.  
- Mongoose - ODM (Object Data Modeling) lib for MongoDB.  
- EJS - template engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.  
- BCrypt - lib for hash and securely storing password.  
- JWT (Json Web Token) - authentication and authorization system.  
- DotENV - loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## üíª Installation and Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prerequisites**
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt)** (LTS version) - required to run backend.  
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)** - database for storing app data. You can install it locally or use a cloud server like **MongoDB Atlas** (I used this one).  
- **Git** (optional) - to clone this repository from GitHub.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Cloning the Repository**
To get a copy of this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:isenf/task-manager.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd task-manager
   ```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Installing Dependencies**
Once you've cloned the repository, run the following command to install the required dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```  
This will install all the necessary libraries and packages specified in the `package.json` file.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Setting Up the `.env` File**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string and the JWT secret key.  
Here‚Äôs an example of the `.env` file:  
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string  
SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key  
PORT=3001
```  
Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB URL (whether local or from MongoDB Atlas), and `your_jwt_secret_key` with a secure string to sign your JWT tokens.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Running the Project**
To start the project, use **Nodemon** to automatically restart the server when changes are made:  
```bash
nodemon app
```  
This will run the app and monitor for changes, making the development process smoother. If you don‚Äôt have **Nodemon** installed globally, you can install it by running:  
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```  
Alternatively, you can add a script in your `package.json` to run the project:  
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon app"
}
```  
Then, you can run the project with:  
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Accessing the Project**
Once the server is running, you can access the project by opening your browser and going to:  
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```  
This will load the app's main page.
